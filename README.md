Overview
---

The Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Lesson2 project is submitted.
In order to keep the original files, a few copies have been made.

#Code
The code can be found in  [mywork.ipynb](mywork.ipynb) see documentation. It has been tested with jupyter and it runs completely.

There are three main blocks:

1. My methods or helpers methods. They are not main methods but helpers methods, Like **PlotImage**. In this block has been developed **draw_lines_extrapolate**. This method is used to find one line that groups all the lines returned by Hough algorithm.
2. # Pipeline. In this block is developped the entire pipeline for finding lane lines.
3. Pipeline example. This block is for plotting, testing and saving the pipeline

#Report
The full report can be found in [writeup_report.md](writeup_report.md)

#Result
The result images can be found in the result_images folder.

The result videos can be found in white.mp4, yellow.mp4 and extra.mp4
